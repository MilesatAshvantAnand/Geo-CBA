                  Christians are monotheistic, that is ,they believe there’s only one God which is both transcendent
                  (wholly independent of, and removed from, the material universe) and immanent (involved in the
                  material universe)They belive that he is the eternal, supreme being who created and preserves all
                  things.<br> This divine Godhead consists of three parts: the father (God himself), the son (Jesus
                  Christ)
                  and the Holy Spirit.
